Subject: URGENT - Configure Clerk JWKS for API Key

Hi Chippi Pay Team,

I'm using the @chipi-stack/nextjs SDK with Clerk authentication and need immediate help.

ERROR: "No JWKS configuration found for API key pk_prod_feb5c9161ca3b70174ae4ff1ba62d441"

Please configure Clerk JWKS for my API key:

API Key: pk_prod_feb5c9161ca3b70174ae4ff1ba62d441
JWKS URL: https://profound-foxhound-78.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json
Issuer: https://profound-foxhound-78.clerk.accounts.dev
Key ID: ins_346GlZcZQA9BNZriw345BkSOIOo
Algorithm: RS256

The JWKS endpoint is active and verified. I just need it configured on your backend for my API key.

Please help ASAP - this is blocking my development.

Thank you!
```

   - Integrations ‚Üí Clerk
   - Authentication Providers
   - JWKS Configuration

4. **If you find it**, add:

   ```

- **Telegram response**: Usually within hours
- **Email response**: Within 24 hours
- **Configuration time**: 2-5 minutes after they configure it
- **Total**: Should be resolved today

## üí° **Why This is Needed:**

This is a **security configuration** on Chippi Pay's backend:
- Your code is perfect ‚úÖ
- Your JWKS is active ‚úÖ
- Chippi Pay just needs to whitelist your Clerk JWKS URL ‚è≥

Once configured, everything will work immediately!
