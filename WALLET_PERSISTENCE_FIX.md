# ‚úÖ Wallet Persistence Fix

## üéØ **Problem**
After Clerk login, users had to create/connect their wallet again on every page refresh because the wallet state was only stored in React `useState`.

## üí° **Solution**
Implemented localStorage persistence to save and restore wallet data across sessions.

## üîß **Changes Made**

### 1. **Wallet State Persistence** (`app/workflow/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Load wallet from localStorage on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const savedWallet = localStorage.getItem('chippi_wallet');
  if (savedWallet) {
    try {
      const walletData = JSON.parse(savedWallet);
      setWallet(walletData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load saved wallet:', error);
      localStorage.removeItem('chippi_wallet');
    }
  }
  setIsLoadingWallet(false);
}, []);

// Save wallet when connected
const handleWalletConnected = (connectedWallet: { address: string; type: string }) => {
  setWallet(connectedWallet);
  localStorage.setItem('chippi_wallet', JSON.stringify(connectedWallet));
};
```

### 2. **Loading State**
Added `isLoadingWallet` state to show a spinner while checking localStorage on page load.

### 3. **Disconnect Wallet Button**
Added a button to disconnect wallet and clear localStorage:
```typescript
const handleDisconnectWallet = () => {
  setWallet(null);
  localStorage.removeItem('chippi_wallet');
};
```

## ‚ú® **Features**

### ‚úÖ **Wallet Persistence**
- Wallet data saved to localStorage after creation/login
- Auto-restored on page refresh
- Survives browser closes and reopens

### ‚úÖ **Loading State**
- Smooth loading spinner while checking for saved wallet
- No flicker between states

### ‚úÖ **Disconnect Wallet**
- Clean disconnect button in the UI
- Clears localStorage completely
- Returns to wallet creation screen

## üîê **Security Notes**

### **Current Implementation (Demo/Development)**
- Wallet data stored in localStorage (browser)
- Includes: `address`, `type`, and wallet metadata
- **Not production-ready for sensitive data**

### **Production Recommendations**
1. **Never store private keys in localStorage**
2. Use Chippi Pay SDK's secure wallet retrieval
3. Store only wallet address and metadata
4. Use Clerk session to verify wallet ownership
5. Implement server-side wallet validation

## üéØ **User Experience Flow**

### **First Visit**
1. User signs in with Clerk
2. Creates/connects Chippi Pay wallet
3. Wallet data saved to localStorage
4. Redirected to workflow builder

### **Returning Visit**
1. User signs in with Clerk
2. App checks localStorage for saved wallet
3. If found, auto-loads wallet data
4. User sees their connected wallet immediately
5. No need to recreate/reconnect wallet

### **Disconnect**
1. User clicks "Disconnect Wallet"
2. Wallet state cleared
3. localStorage cleared
4. Returns to wallet creation screen

## üìä **localStorage Structure**

```json
{
  "chippi_wallet": {
    "address": "0x1234...5678",
    "type": "Chippi Pay SDK (Clerk Authenticated)"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **For Production**
1. Integrate Chippi Pay SDK's `useGetWallet` hook
2. Verify wallet ownership via Clerk session
3. Implement server-side wallet validation
4. Add wallet recovery flow
5. Add multi-wallet support

### **Enhancement Ideas**
- Show wallet creation date
- Display wallet balance
- Add wallet nickname feature
- Support multiple wallets per user
- Add wallet export/backup

## ‚úÖ **Testing Checklist**

- [x] Wallet persists after page refresh
- [x] Wallet persists after browser close/reopen
- [x] Disconnect wallet clears localStorage
- [x] Loading state shows during check
- [x] No errors in console
- [x] Smooth UX transitions

## üéâ **Result**
Users now have a seamless experience:
- **One-time wallet creation** per Clerk account
- **Auto-reconnect** on every visit
- **Clean disconnect** when needed
- **Professional UX** with loading states
